## Project Based Prompts

 1. What are the ways to analyze this dataset to import the e-commerce company's sales ?
 2. how we can we perform customer segmentation on this dataset? What are the steps that need to be taken
 3.  What are the ways to decide the number of clusters (K) in K-Means clustering ?
 4.  Can we visualize the clusters that were created? 
     Let's create a separate chart for each cluster. 
     Each chart should showcase the cluster's mean R, F, and M scores.
 5. Based on their RFM scores alone, can you come up with some 
    personalized targeting recommendations on the best way to 
    reach each customer segment?
