         Median -
         
         Data Leakage-
         
         Pipeline from sklearn -
         
         Data Preprocessing -
         
         Understand the different steps before building model -
         
         Standarization or Normalization -
         
         Scalling and Centering -
         
         Main supervised learning models -
         
         How do we decide which model should we use in the first place ?

                  Important ponts - 1. Import necessary models
                                    2. Feature and Target
                                    3. Split the data
                                    4. Then scale the data both train and test set
         
         build a pipeline to impute missing values, scale features, and perform hyperparameter tuning
