This robot's job is to draw the best possible straight line on a graph that goes through a bunch of dots you've marked. The goal is to draw the line as close as possible to all the dots.\n\nNow, there are many ways this robot can draw the line. Each time it draws a line, it makes little adjustments to get closer to the dots. The robot might draw slightly different lines if you give it different sets of dots.\n\nThe \"variance\" in the robot's lines tells us how much the lines change when we give it different sets of dots. If the variance is high, it means the lines can change a lot, and the robot might not always draw the best line.\n\nBut if the variance is low, it means the robot's lines are more stable and don't change too much with different sets of dots. This is good because it shows that the robot can draw a good line consistently, no matter what dots you give it.\n\nSo, when we talk about \"variance\" in linear regression, we are looking at how much the lines drawn by the robot can change with different data. Low variance is better because it means the robot is good at drawing accurate lines no matter what data you give it!","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### What is R-squared","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![R-Squared Superhero](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UkIlIZrFD_yS8rTkOuNbht_IwWNblrrn/view?usp=sharing)\n\nImagine you have a superhero who can fly and save people from danger. Now, this superhero's job is to predict how fast a car can go based on its engine size. So the superhero looks at lots of cars and makes predictions.\n\nR-squared is like a score that tells us how good the superhero's predictions are. It's a number between 0 and 1, where 1 means the superhero's predictions are perfect, and 0 means the predictions are terrible.\n\nTo understand this score, you can think of it as a percentage. For example, if the superhero's R-squared is 0.8, it means the predictions are about 80% accurate. If it's 0.5, then the predictions are about 50% accurate, which is like flipping a coin to guess the car's speed.\n\nThe R-squared score helps us know if the superhero is doing a good job or not. The closer the R-squared is to 1, the better the predictions, and the more confident we can be in the superhero's abilities.\n\nSo, in summary, R-squared is like a measure of how well the superhero can predict car speeds based on engine size. A higher R-squared means more accurate predictions, and a lower R-squared means less accurate predictions. It's a way to know how good the superhero's superpower of prediction really is!","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### What is MSE (Mean Squared Error)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![MSE Dart](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uSlr-DP-jSixg2QK6dKPRFRNfDhFX8V1/view?usp=drive_link)\n\nImagine you have a friend who loves to play darts. They throw darts at a target, and you want to know how good they are at hitting the bullseye. The closer their darts land to the center, the better they are.\n\nMSE is like a way to measure how good your friend is at hitting the center of the target with their darts. It takes all the distances between where each dart lands and the center of the target, squares those distances, adds them up, and then divides by the number of darts.\n\nSo, if your friend's darts are very close to the center, the MSE will be small. It means they are very accurate. But if their darts are all over the place and far from the center, the MSE will be larger. It means they are not very accurate.\n\nIn the world of math and data, we use MSE to measure how well a prediction model is doing. Instead of darts, we have predictions, and instead of the target center, we have the real correct values. The model's \"accuracy\" is like how close its predictions are to the correct values. A low MSE means the model's predictions are very close to the real values, which is good. A high MSE means the predictions are not accurate, and the model needs improvement.\n\nSo, in simple terms, MSE is like a way to measure how accurate a prediction model is, just like your friend's darts show how accurate they are at hitting the center of the target. The lower the MSE, the better the model is at making accurate predictions!","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### What is Residual","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![Residual Machine](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wu4UspMVgT6T_ST22salKimmT2LcVrQw/view?usp=drive_link)\n\nImagine you have a magical scale that can predict the weight of objects. You place different objects on the scale, and it gives you its predictions of the weight. However, the scale is not perfect, and sometimes it makes mistakes in its predictions.\n\nA residual is like the \"mistake\" or \"error\" made by the magical scale. It is the difference between the actual weight of an object and the weight predicted by the scale.\n\nFor example, if the magical scale predicts that a toy weighs 500 grams, but in reality, it weighs 490 grams, the residual would be 10 grams (500 - 490).\n\nResiduals can be positive or negative. If the prediction is higher than the actual value, the residual is positive. If the prediction is lower than the actual value, the residual is negative.\n\nIn the world of data and statistics, we use residuals to measure how well a prediction model is doing. The goal of the model is to make predictions as close to the real values as possible. So, when we analyze residuals, we want them to be as small as possible.\n\nIf the residuals are close to zero, it means the model is doing a good job in its predictions. But if the residuals are large, it means the model is making bigger mistakes, and we need to improve it.\n\nSo, in simple terms, residuals are like the \"mistakes\" made by a magical scale or a prediction model. By looking at these residuals, we can tell how accurate the scale or the model is in its predictions. The closer the residuals are to zero, the better the predictions are!","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Explain Mean, STD and Confidence Interval","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![Confidence Interval](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m0M7k_uOsXQ2eWzthCunyY8YgnrEzR2F/view?usp=drive_link)\n\nMean:\nThe mean is like finding the \"average\" amount of chocolates each of your friends should get. Imagine you have a bunch of chocolates, and you want to know how many chocolates each of your friends should receive so that everyone gets an equal share. You count the chocolates and divide the total number by the number of friends to find the mean or average number of chocolates each friend should get.\n\nStandard Deviation (std):\nThe standard deviation is like a measure of how spread out the numbers of chocolates are from the mean. If you and your friends have different amounts of chocolates, the standard deviation would tell you how much their chocolate count varies from the average. If everyone has almost the same number of chocolates, the standard deviation is small, but if some have a lot more or a lot fewer than the average, the standard deviation is larger.\n\nConfidence Interval:\nNow, imagine you have a big jar of chocolates, and you want to know how many chocolates are inside. Instead of counting all of them, you take a small sample of chocolates and count those. The confidence interval tells you the range of values that the actual number of chocolates inside the jar is likely to be, based on your small sample.\n\nFor example, if you count 20 chocolates in your sample, and the confidence interval is 18 to 22 chocolates, it means you are pretty confident that the actual number of chocolates in the jar is somewhere between 18 and 22. The larger the sample size, the more confident you can be about your estimate.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### What is Coefficient","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![Coefficient](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DGQwXWu6FuZ7rTou0aQqMw8k9ks9ttmm/view?usp=drive_link)\n\nImagine you have a special machine that can predict how much ice cream you can eat based on how hot it is outside. The more the sun shines, the more ice cream you want to eat.\n\nNow, this machine needs some special numbers to make its predictions. These special numbers are called \"coefficients.\" They help the machine know how much the number of ice creams you eat changes when the temperature outside changes by just a little bit.\n\nFor example, let's say the machine's coefficient is 2. That means, for every one-degree increase in temperature, you will want to eat two more ice creams. If the coefficient is -1, it means for every one-degree increase in temperature, you will want to eat one less ice cream.\n\nThe coefficients are like magic keys that help the machine make the right predictions. They tell the machine how much one thing affects the other thing.\n\nSo, in simple terms, coefficients are special numbers that help the magic machine predict how much ice cream you want to eat based on how hot it is outside. They are like the secret sauce that makes the machine work!","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Explain *coefficient* in Linear Regression","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![Coefficient in Linear Regression](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-bEDnMcaxhSumc-RCxzauFqY_Ui80tBk/view?usp=drive_link)\n\nImagine you have a magical superhero who can draw straight lines on a graph. Your superhero's job is to draw the best possible straight line that fits a bunch of points on the graph.\n\nIn linear regression, the coefficient is like a special number that your superhero uses to draw the line. The superhero looks at the points on the graph and uses this coefficient to determine how steep or shallow the line should be and where it should cross the y-axis.\n\nLet's say you have some data points representing the number of hours studied (X) and the corresponding test scores (y) of students. Your superhero uses the coefficient to draw a line that best represents the relationship between hours studied and test scores.\n\nIf the coefficient is positive, it means the superhero's line goes uphill, showing that as students study more, their test scores tend to increase. If the coefficient is negative, the line goes downhill, suggesting that more study time is associated with lower test scores.\n\nThe coefficient is essential because it helps your superhero make predictions. For example, if a student studies for 5 hours, your superhero can use the coefficient to predict what the student's test score might be.\n\nIn summary, the coefficient in linear regression is like a special number that determines the slope and position of the best-fitting line on a graph. It helps the superhero make predictions about one variable (test scores) based on another variable (hours studied). It's like the superhero's superpower to draw the most accurate line that represents the relationship between the two variables.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### What is Intercept","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![Intercept](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Gmo7vUAZMPPOIFU8GKVwHe7rEE_HItNj/view?usp=drive_link)\n\nImagine you have a friend who loves to draw lines on a piece of paper. One day, you give your friend some dots on the paper and ask them to draw a line that goes through the dots.\n\nThe intercept is like a magical starting point for your friend's line. It's where the line begins on the paper. Your friend needs this special starting point to know where to draw the line.\n\nFor example, if the intercept is 3, it means your friend starts drawing the line from the number 3 on the side of the paper. If the intercept is -2, the line starts from below the paper at -2.\n\nOnce your friend has the starting point, they use their magic pen (called the coefficient) to draw the line in the right direction. The coefficient helps them decide if the line should go up or down and how steep or flat it should be.\n\nSo, in simple terms, the intercept is like the magical starting point for your friend's line. It's where the line begins, and then the coefficient helps draw the line in the right way. Together, the intercept and coefficient help your friend draw the perfect line that goes through all the dots you gave them.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### What is Loss Function","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![Loss Function](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C8ChR0kv0xlSkePB2VXVPVBZlawwzvJb/view?usp=drive_link)\n\nImagine you are playing a game where you need to hit a target with a dart. The goal is to throw the dart as close to the center of the target as possible. But, as with any game, you won't always hit the bullseye perfectly; your throws will have some distance away from the center.\n\nThe loss function is like a measure of how far your dart is from the center of the target. It tells you how much you missed the bullseye by. The closer your dart is to the center, the smaller the loss, and the better you are at the game.\n\nIn the world of data and machine learning, the loss function is similar. When we build models to make predictions (like predicting house prices or recognizing images), we want the model to make accurate predictions. But, the model won't always be perfect; it will make some errors.\n\nThe loss function measures these errors by calculating how far off the model's predictions are from the actual values. If the model's predictions are very close to the actual values, the loss will be small. But if the predictions are way off, the loss will be large.\n\nThe goal in machine learning is to minimize the loss, meaning we want to make the errors as small as possible. To do this, we use optimization algorithms that adjust the model's parameters (like coefficients in linear regression) to find the best values that give us the smallest loss.\n\nSo, in simple terms, the loss function is like a way to measure how well our model is doing at making predictions. Smaller loss means better predictions, just like hitting the target closer to the bullseye means you are good at the dart game!","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### What is Confusion Matrix","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![Confusion Matrix](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XmPdNDqUplegsBc0yLRUMpx_TWuL6stC/view?usp=drive_link)\n\nImagine you have a friend who loves to play a game where they need to identify animals based on pictures. Your friend's job is to look at pictures of animals and tell if they are dogs or cats.\n\nThe confusion matrix is like a special scoreboard that keeps track of your friend's performance in the game. It counts how many times your friend makes the right decisions and how many times they make mistakes.\n\nThe confusion matrix has four parts, like this:\n\n\n> >             | Predicted Dog  | Predicted Cat\n> -------------------------------------------\n> >  Actual Dog | True Positive  | False Negative\n> -------------------------------------------\n> >  Actual Cat | False Positive | True Negative\n\nHere's what each part means:\n\n1.

True Negative: It's like a point your friend gets when they correctly identify a picture of a cat as a cat. Another correct guess!\n3. False Positive: It's like a point your friend loses when they mistakenly think a picture of a cat is a dog. Oops, a little mistake!\n4. False Negative: It's like a point your friend loses when they mistakenly think a picture of a dog is a cat. Oops, another mistake!\n\nThe confusion matrix helps us see how well your friend is doing in the game. We want more true positives and true negatives because they mean your friend is making correct predictions. But we want fewer false positives and false negatives because they mean your friend is making mistakes.\n\nSo, in simple terms, the confusion matrix is like a special scoreboard that shows how well your friend is identifying animals.

It helps us understand how well the model is making predictions on different classes (categories) of data. Here are some important applications of the confusion matrix in machine learning:\n\n1. Model Evaluation: The confusion matrix allows us to calculate various performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall (sensitivity), specificity, and F1-score, which provide valuable insights into the model's effectiveness.\n\n2. Error Analysis: By examining the false positives and false negatives in the confusion matrix, we can identify the types of mistakes the model is making and gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the model.\n\n3. Class Imbalance: In real-world datasets, classes may not be evenly distributed. The confusion matrix helps us identify if there is any class imbalance, which is crucial for dealing with scenarios where one class dominates the others.\n\n4. Model Selection and Tuning: When comparing multiple models or tuning hyperparameters, we can use the confusion matrix to choose the best-performing model or set the hyperparameters that minimize misclassifications.\n\n5. Threshold Selection: Some classification models provide probability scores for predictions. The confusion matrix can help us choose an optimal threshold for converting probabilities into class labels, balancing precision and recall.\n\n6. Multi-Class Classification: The confusion matrix can be extended to evaluate the performance of multi-class classification models, where there are more than two classes to predict.\n\n7. Anomaly Detection: In some cases, one class represents normal data, and other classes represent anomalies. The confusion matrix helps identify how well the model is detecting anomalies.\n\nOverall, the confusion matrix is a versatile tool that helps us gain a deeper understanding of a classification model's performance and make informed decisions when building and improving machine learning models. It provides valuable information to assess the model's accuracy, generalization ability, and areas where it may need improvement.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### What is performance metric's elements such as accuracy, precision, recall (sensitivity), specificity, and F1-score ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![Different Performance Metrics](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WV9yTVp3QnlGlTv-EpS06EUcEe2Iqph2/view?usp=drive_link)\n\nImagine you have a friend who loves to play different games. Your friend is very competitive and always wants to know how well they are doing in each game. To measure their performance, you use special tools that give you specific scores for different aspects of their gameplay.\n\nPerformance metrics are like those special tools for measuring how well your friend is doing in a game. They help you get more detailed information about your friend's performance.\n\nHere are some of these performance metrics:\n\n1. **Accuracy**: Accuracy is like a score that tells you how many times your friend's guesses were correct (both true positives and true negatives) out of all the guesses they made.
